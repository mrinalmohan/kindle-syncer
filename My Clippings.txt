Dharma means the quintessential duty or knowledge that elevates our consciousness to a direct connection with the Absolute Truth. This is also known as sanåtana-dharma, the occupational duty of all living beings. The Bhagavad-gîtå begins with the word dharma – thus we can understand from the outset that Bhagavad-gîtå is not about dogma or a sectarian way of thinking.Indeed, Bhagavad-gîtå is the complete science of realising the Absolute Truth.
